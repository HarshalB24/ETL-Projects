**Problem Statement**

Retail businesses generate large volumes of order data, but this raw data is often unstructured and difficult to analyze directly. The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights from a retail orders dataset by performing a complete end-to-end data workflow. This includes data cleaning, transformation, storage, and analysis using Python and SQL, simulating a real-world ETL and analytics scenario.

--- Specifically, the project addresses the following challenges:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing, inconsistent, or malformed data in the raw orders dataset.\

Data Transformation: Creating derived metrics and aggregations for business insights (e.g., total sales, order counts, product popularity).

Data Storage: Loading the cleaned and transformed data into a SQL database to enable efficient querying.

Data Analysis: Extracting actionable insights using SQL queries to understand trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

Reporting: Preparing the insights in a structured format to support business decisions.

**Objectives**

Load the orders.csv dataset using Python and handle missing or inconsistent data.

Transform the dataset to compute metrics such as total sales per product, top-selling products, and customer purchase patterns.

Load the cleaned and transformed data into a SQL database (e.g., SQL Server using SSMS).

Use SQL queries to generate insights and summaries for business decision-making.

-- (Optional) Visualize trends and patterns using Python or reporting tools. [This part is not covered in this project]
